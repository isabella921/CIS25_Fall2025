this code is a inventory management systen that uses arrays.
my code uses an item close that stores the items name as a string and its quantity as an integer
the inventory items are stored in a fixed array of item objects
the user can input a name and quantity for a set number of items at the start of the testing program
The display inventory method lists all of the items that are currently in the inventory along with the quantities
I added an optional search by name method that finds and displays the quantity of the item a user wants
The update item quantity method allows the user to change the quantity of an item they choose
the delete item by name method allows the user to remove an item from the inventory by searching for its name (this was also optional)

in the testing program, first an inventory array is initialized
Then uses currentItemcount an integer to track the actual number of items that are in the array
Then i have the user input, display, update, delete, and search for items to test each method.

this week i had to learn more about how to delete items from fixed arrays by reading online. because i only have prior experience with python, i found the method to delete items very interesting
thank you!
