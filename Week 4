Week 4: 
The if statement menu does the following:

First it prints 4 options for the user to choose: 1. Upload a link, 2. View videos, 3. Remove a video, and 4. exit.
Then it stores the users input in the variable choice.

If the choice is 1, the code prints a line asking the user to upload the link. Then it stores this link in variable link.
If the choice is 2, then the code prints "Loading videos.."
If the choice is 3, the code prints "Removing video.."
If the choice is 4, the code prints "Exiting"
If the choice is not of the 4 options list (else), then the code prints that this is an invalid choice and asks the user to restart.

The largest number program does the following:

It first asks the user to input 3 numbers, which are stored in the variables n1, n2, and n3.
If the first number is greater than or equal to BOTH n2 and n3, then it prints that the largest number is n1.
If the second number is greater than or equal to BOTH n1 and n3, then it prints that the largest number is n2.
If the third number is greater than or equal to BOTH n2 and n3(which will fall under the else statement), then it prints that the largest number is n3.
