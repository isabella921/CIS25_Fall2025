This program first creates a type named Item that stores an item's string name and a unique integer id. This code first sets up an inventory, by creating an array of 100 inventory items, each with a unique name and uniqe item id.
This code allows the user to search the inventory for a specific item id through a binary search, but needs the array to be sorted by id number.
Then it tells the user whether the asked id was found in the inventory.
Then, the code asks the coputer for the exact chunk of memory, using dynamic allocation. Then, after the program is done, it clears the memory for the computer to use for something eelse.
