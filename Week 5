Week 5:

The main.cpp file prints 3 options for a menu and takes the input and runs the appropriate function based on the choice. 
Choice 1 is adding two numbers, the code first takes the first input and saves it as first, takes the second input and saves it as second, and then prints the sum of the two numbers
Choice 2 runs a function that prints a greeting to the user.
Choice 3 exits the menu.

The fuctions.h header file contains the declarations for the addnumbers() and sayhello() functions.
The functions.cpp file contains the actual code/instructions for each function that is declared in functions.h.
